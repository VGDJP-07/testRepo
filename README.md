# testRepo- testing out ubuntu and gitbash with ssh and https
- test repo for git bash and Unbuntu
- I had Gitbash setup for use with gitHub from previous learnings.
- Current learning has Ubuntu setup on PC with WSL and ssh.
- just trying to understand the workings of ssh when using different interface.
# ssh
- If https clone is used instead of ssh username and password will be required when 'git push' on ubuntu- when ssh has been set on ubuntu.
# Gitbash
- Cannot push using git bash
error message:
- git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
- fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
- Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
- gitbash works well with https git clone.
